            "explanation": "Dear Brandon,\r\n\r\nCongratulations on your recent STARS submission!  AASHE commends the University of Western Ontario for demonstrating its commitment to sustainability by participating in STARS.  During a standard review of recent submissions, we came across an inconsistency that we hoped to get your feedback on:  \r\n\r\nWestern\u2019s submission states that the Institute for Chemicals and Fuel from Alternative Resources is excluded from the institutional boundary.  However, Western claims the Institute for one of its innovation credits.  A key characteristic of the institutional boundary is that, although institutions may choose to exclude facilities from their report, the selected boundary must be the same for every credit.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you can review the information for Innovation Credit #3 and provide an update to your STARS report.  Our recommendation is to remove Innovation credit #3 from the submission, since this simple fix results in a one-point drop that allows Western to retain its Silver rating.  The alternative would be to update the institutional boundary and all related credits to reflect impacts from the Institute for Chemicals and Fuel from Alternative Resources.  \r\n\r\nYou can make the change by submitting a Data Corrections Request through Western\u2019s STARS Report.  Simply view the credit to be updated on the STARS website and click on the icon next to that credit. The icon will lead you to the Data Corrections Request Form.  Once again, thank you for your submission, and we look forward to hearing from you for feedback and to answer any questions.  \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMonika Urbanski\r\nSTARS Program Analyst\r\nAASHE",
