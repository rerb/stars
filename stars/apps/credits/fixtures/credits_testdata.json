Sighting a single pest does not always mean control is needed. The level at which pests will become an economic threat is critical to guide future pest control decisions.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Monitor and Identify Pests &ndash; </em></strong><em>Not all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. Many organisms are innocuous, and some are even beneficial. IPM programs work to monitor for pests and identify them accurately, so that appropriate control decisions can be made in conjunction with action thresholds. This monitoring and identification removes the possibility that pesticides will be used when they are not really needed or that the wrong kind of pesticide will be used.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Prevention</em></strong><em> &ndash; As&nbsp; a first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, lawn, or indoor space to prevent pests from becoming a threat. In an agricultural crop, this may mean using cultural methods, such as rotating between different crops, selecting pest-resistant varieties, and planting pest-free rootstock. These control methods can be very effective and cost-efficient and present little to no risk to people or the environment.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Control</em></strong><em> &ndash; Once monitoring, identification, and action thresholds indicate that pest control is required, and preventive methods are no longer effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the proper control method both for effectiveness and risk. Effective, less risky pest controls are chosen first, including highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. If further monitoring, identifications and action thresholds indicate that less risky controls are not working, then additional pest control methods would be employed, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last resort.</em></p>"

All commercial buildings, as defined by standard building codes, are eligible for certification as LEED for New Construction buildings. Examples of commercial occupancies include offices, institutional buildings (libraries, museums, churches, etc.), hotels, and residential buildings of 4 or more habitable stories.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for New Construction addresses design and construction activities for both new buildings and major renovations of existing buildings. A major renovation involves major HVAC renovation, significant envelope modifications, and major interior rehabilitation. For a major renovation of an existing building, LEED for New Construction is the appropriate rating system. If the project scope does not involve significant design and construction activities and focuses more on operations and maintenance activities, LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance is more appropriate because it addresses operational and maintenance issues of working buildings.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Some projects are designed and constructed to be partially occupied by the owner or developer, and partially occupied by others tenants. In such projects, the owner or developer has direct influence over the portion of the work that they occupy. For such a project to pursue LEED for New Construction certification, the owner or tenant must occupy more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage. Projects in which 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage is occupied by an owner should pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=145\" target=\"_blank\">LEED for Commercial Interiors</a></strong> is a green building design and construction rating system for tenant improvement projects.&nbsp; The U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for Commercial Interiors&rdquo;:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Commercial Interiors addresses the specifics of tenant spaces primarily in office, retail, and institutional buildings. Tenants who lease their space or do not occupy the entire building are eligible.</em></p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>3.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=295\" target=\"_blank\">LEED for Core and Shell</a></strong> is a green building design and construction rating system for developers of multi-tenant buildings.&nbsp; The U.S. Green Building Council describes &ldquo;When to Use LEED for Core and Shell&rdquo;:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System is a market-specific application that recognizes the unique nature of core and shell development. The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System acknowledges the limited level of influence a developer can exert in a speculatively developed building.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Core &amp; Shell was developed to serve the speculative development market, in which project teams do not control all scopes of a whole building&rsquo;s design and construction. Depending on how the project is structured, this scope can vary significantly from project to project. The LEED for Core &amp; Shell Rating System addresses a variety of project types and a broad project range.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>LEED for Core &amp; Shell can be used for projects in which the developer controls the design and construction of the entire core and shell base building (e.g., mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection systems) but has no control over the design and construction of the tenant fit-out. Examples of this type of project can be a commercial office building, medical office building, retail center, warehouse, and lab facility.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>If a project is designed and constructed to be partially occupied by the owner or developer, then the owner or developer has direct influence over that portion of the interior build-out work. For these projects to pursue LEED for Core &amp; Shell certification, the owner must occupy 50% or less of the building&rsquo;s leasable square footage. Projects in which more than 50% of the building&rsquo;s tenant space is occupied by a owner should pursue LEED for New Construction certification.</em></p>"

To help facilitate the sale of renewable electricity nationally, a system was established that separates renewable electricity generation into two parts: the electricity or electrical energy produced by a renewable generator and the renewable &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; of that generation. (These attributes include the tons of greenhouse gas that were avoided by generating electricity from renewable resources instead of conventional fuels, such as coal, nuclear, oil, or gas.) These renewable (&ldquo;green&rdquo;) attributes are sold separately as renewable energy certificates (RECs). One REC is issued for each megawatt-hour (MWh) unit of renewable electricity produced. The electricity that was split from the REC is no longer considered \"renewable\" and cannot be counted as renewable or zero-emissions by whoever buys it.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>RECs contain specific information about the renewable energy generated, including where, when, at what facility, and with what type of generation. Purchasers of RECs are buying the renewable attributes of those specific units of renewable energy, which helps offset conventional electricity generation in the region where the renewable generator is located.</em></p>"
